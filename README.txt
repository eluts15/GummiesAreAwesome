This can be done in a few ways, but first clone the project and run:
	 Ctrl+Shft+b 
This command will compile/build the application.

Next, access the package manager console by navigating to View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console

Run: Update-Database -Context GummyBearKingdomTokyoContext
This should generate the database.
